  Welcome to the monthly report of iNaturalist observations of species on the Maine Bird Records Committee review list. These are observations submitted from `r start` to `r end` from within the boundaries of the state. 
  
  The observations in this report come from an open source citizen science project called iNaturalist. The records here are both casual and research grade observations, so erroneous identifications are very possible. This project is adapted from products made by Schoodic Institute at Acadia National Park.
